The goal of the project is to develop a framework to working with databases and to introduce the database records as JESS facts. This framework allows JESS to interact with a database:
•	to connect the database;
•	to load the database records as JESS facts.
•	to insert new facts as record in the database;
•	to modify JESS facts and at the same time the “same” records from the database.
